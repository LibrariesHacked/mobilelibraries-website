## Privacy

These pages were created by Dave. You can [contact me via email](mailto:info@librarieshacked.org) should you have any questions.

### GitHub pages

This site is hosted using [GitHub pages](https://pages.github.com/). Although this site does not directly record any user data, it is important to be aware that website hosting providers can store web traffic data that could include information such as your IP address.

GitHub has its own [privacy statement](https://help.github.com/en/github/site-policy/github-privacy-statement). The majority of this is in reference to logged-in services within GitHub, but there is a reference to GitHub pages sites in this policy. In addition to advising that GitHub pages sites should have their own privacy policy (this one), it informs us that logs of visitor IP addresses can be used for security purposes. This does not include user tracking or marketing. A quote of this is displayed below, but a maintained version will be on the GitHub site.

> “Please note that GitHub may collect Technical Information from visitors to your GitHub Pages website, including logs of visitor IP addresses, to maintain the security and integrity of the website and service.”

### Cloudflare cookie

Cookies are files saved on your phone, tablet or computer when you visit a website.

This site uses [Cloudflare](https://www.cloudflare.com/), to ensure we provide the site using encryption (see the 'https' at the start of the address), as well as maximising the security and performance of the website.

Cloudflare creates a single cookie on your computer when you use this website. The cookie is necessary to deliver their security features, such as identifying when a malicious user is suspected of attempting to overload a website. This would display a challenge to the user, blocking them from repeated requests.

This functionality uses your IP address, but anonymises it so that it can not be identified in future. The cookie is not used for any cross-site tracking, or marketing purposes. More details are available at the [Cloudflare description of the use of cookies](https://support.cloudflare.com/hc/en-us/articles/200170156-Understanding-the-Cloudflare-Cookies#12345682).

### Tracking and analytics

There are no marketing or analytics trackers set on this website. We do not store your personal data or usage data.
